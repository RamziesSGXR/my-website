You might not have feedback from your peers if you did not turn in your assignments on time or if a peer that was assigned to review your website did not complete their review. 
If you don't have any or enough feedback from peers, for whatever reason, 
make your own assessment of your website (based on what we learned in Ch 16) and make & document those improvements.
