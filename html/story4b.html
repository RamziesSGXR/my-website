            <p>Tommy unlocks the box and wishes for infinite knowledge. 
                He becomes the smartest person in the world, but his friends struggle to connect with him as he becomes more and more absorbed in his own thoughts.
                 Tommy helps the town with his knowledge, but he finds himself increasingly lonely.
